# A coefficient theorem for hedgehog plucking polynomials

For a hedgehog with `n` rays and delays in `{1,2}`, Proposition 2.5 of
Ibarra--Landry--Montoya-Vega--Przytycki gives

  Q(q) = p_n(q) * [n-1]_q!,

where every coefficient of `p_n` is zero or one. `Window r a` is the
coefficient sequence obtained by multiplying the Laurent coefficient sequence
`a` by `[r]_q = 1 + q + ... + q^(r-1)`. Thus `DescendWindows (n-1) a`
is the coefficient sequence of `p_n(q) * [n-1]_q!`.
