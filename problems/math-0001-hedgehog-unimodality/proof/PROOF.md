# Proof of the zero-one quantum-factorial theorem

## Theorem

Let

\[
p(q)=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\varepsilon_iq^i,
\qquad \varepsilon_i\in\{0,1\}.
\]

Then

\[
p(q)[n-1]_q!
\]

has a unimodal coefficient sequence, where
\([r]_q=1+q+\cdots+q^{r-1}\).

Together with Proposition 2.5 of Ibarra--Landry--Montoya-Vega--Przytycki,
which identifies a hedgehog plucking polynomial with exactly this product,
this proves their Conjecture 4.1 for delays in `{1,2}`.

## 1. The first quantum-integer factor

Extend the coefficient sequence by zero outside `0,...,n-1`; write it as
`a_k`. Let `c_k` be the coefficient of `q^k` in `p(q)[n-1]_q`. Thus

\[
c_k=\sum_{j=0}^{n-2}a_{k-j}.
\]

Adjacent coefficients satisfy

\[
c_{k+1}-c_k=a_{k+1}-a_{k-n+2}.
\]

There are only three regimes.

- If `k<n-2`, then the exiting term vanishes and `c_{k+1}-c_k=a_{k+1}\ge 0`.
- If `k=n-2`, then `c_{n-1}-c_{n-2}=a_{n-1}-a_0`; this chooses whether the mode is `n-2` or `n-1`.
- If `k\ge n-1`, then `a_{k+1}=0`, so `c_{k+1}-c_k=-a_{k-n+2}\le 0`.

Hence `p(q)[n-1]_q` is unimodal.

## 2. A moving window preserves unimodality

Let `(a_k)` be any weakly unimodal sequence and let

\[
b_k=\sum_{j=0}^{r-1}a_{k-j}.
\]

Then

\[
b_{k+1}-b_k=a_{k+1}-a_{k+1-r}. \tag{1}
\]

Suppose `a` has a mode at `m`. Choose the least `t` in `0,...,r-1` for which

\[
a_{m+t+1}\le a_{m+t+1-r}. \tag{2}
\]

Such a `t` exists: at `t=r-1`, inequality (2) becomes `a_{m+r}\le a_m`.

For `k<m+t`, the right-hand side of (1) is nonnegative: before `m`, both compared indices lie on the nondecreasing side; in the transition range this follows from minimality of `t`.

For `k\ge m+t`, it is nonpositive: eventually both indices lie on the nonincreasing side, while throughout the transition range the leading endpoint can only decrease and the trailing endpoint can only increase, so inequality (2) persists.

Thus `b_k` increases up to `m+t` and decreases afterward. Multiplication by `[r]_q` preserves unimodality.

## 3. Finish

By Section 1, `p(q)[n-1]_q` is unimodal. Apply the moving-window lemma successively for

\[
[n-2]_q,[n-3]_q,\ldots,[1]_q.
\]

The final product is `p(q)[n-1]_q!`, hence it is unimodal.

## Lean correspondence

In `formal/Hedgehog.lean`:

- `Window r a` represents multiplication by `[r]_q` at coefficient level;
- `window_succ_sub_window` is identity (1);
- `window_preserves_unimodal` formalizes Section 2;
- `binary_first_window_unimodal` formalizes Section 1;
- `binary_quantumFactorial_unimodal` proves the stronger theorem;
- `hedgehog_plucking_coefficients_unimodal` specializes it to arbitrary zero-one delay indicators.

The formal theorem is stronger than the required specialization because it covers every zero-one polynomial supported in `0,...,n-1`.
